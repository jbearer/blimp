# The __run command from the bootstrap prelude forces whatever follows it to
# be executed eagerly. Thus, if this file is prepended to another, the
# contents of the second file will be automatically executed. __run is a no-op
# if followed by EOF, so if this file is imported normally, this will have no
# effect.
