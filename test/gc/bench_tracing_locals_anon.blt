# Tests garbage collection of local variables; that is, objects which are
# referenced by a parent object (or a parent of a parent, etc.).
#
# This is the same test as erc_locals_anon, but it runs with tracing on and
# enhanced reference counting is disabled. It should be slower than the ERC
# version of the test, otherwise ERC isn't gaining us anything compared to
# tracing. If you change either the blimp-timeout value above or the one in
# erc_locals_anon, check that erc_locals_anon is still faster than
# tracing_locals_anon.
