# Tests garbage collection of local variables; that is, objects which are
# referenced by a parent object (or a parent of a parent, etc.). These seem easy
# to collect, since the references are all fairly local and acyclic. However,
# these kinds of references create cycles with the internal parent pointers,
# making collection a bit tricky.
#
# This test is similar to bench_erc_locals_anon. However, unlike that test,
# where the scope with the locals is completely transient, the scope containing
# the locals here is temporarily referenced by a long-lived object before being
# released. This means that it briefly becomes entangled with the long-lived
# object, making it more difficult to collect.
