# 10-element cycles, and then breaks each cycle.

# This is the same test as refcount_cycle_broken, but it runs with tracing on
# and reference counting is disabled. It should be slower than the reference
# counting version of the test, otherwise reference counting isn't gaining us
# anything compared to tracing.
