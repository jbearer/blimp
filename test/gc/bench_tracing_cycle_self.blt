# Tests garbage collection of self-cycles. Creates 1 million objects and gives
# each one a reference to itself.
#
# This is the same test as refcount_cycle_self, but it runs with tracing on and
# reference counting is disabled. It should be slower than the reference
# counting version of the test, otherwise reference counting isn't gaining us
# anything compared to tracing.
